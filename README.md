# Micro-Matter-Switch
Micro Matter Switch (MMS) is a small compact stitch based on ESP32 C6 Xiao<br>
<b>Note:</b> Code based on Espressif examples but it's heavily restructured by adm1nsys.
<h1>Board</h1>
For this project I have used ESP32 C6 Xiao because it's realy tiny. This project can be compiled for another ESP32 but you have to make new case and inicialize your pins.

<h1>Case</h1>
As a material I recomend to use PETG becouse it's easy to print, enough strong, have a lot of colours.
